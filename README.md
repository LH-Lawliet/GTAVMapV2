# GTAV map V2

This is a little project made to test somes algorithms learned in class at [ENIB](https://enib.fr) in semester 6
It's using react to handle the display

The contols are quite simple, you need to press m to get in full screen mode and use your mouse to choose the destination point

By default you are placed on the position (0,0) but there is an event that you can call in game to place you accordingly to you ingame position


To run the project (you should have nodejs and npm installed):
- npm i
- npm start
